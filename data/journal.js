    "body": "# The Ledger of Echo  \r\n*Entry the First — North from Cymbri*  \r\n*Recorded by [[corven-profile]]*\r\n\r\nThe city of **Cymbri** fell behind us like a page turned. The road took the rest.  \r\nThere were wagons, oxen that worked without complaint, and too many people who believed numbers protect them.  \r\nThe **Watchful Order** patrols this stretch — or so they say.  \r\nIt is also true there are more bandits than badges.\r\n\r\nThe caravan master hired near twenty guards to make up the difference.  \r\nHe did better than that. He hired [[brand]].  \r\nPeople on horseback do not look much taller than him when he walks beside the lead wagon.  \r\nHe says he is the brute squad. No one laughs at him for saying it.\r\n\r\nWork was given out.  \r\nI took the books — feed out, grain counted, costs marked so the master could take it off his budget.  \r\nMy mount is small and temperamental, which fits the job and me both.\r\n\r\nThe road teaches names.  \r\nThe big one is **Brand with a D.** He insists on it.  \r\nHe also insists on calling me *Bird*. I told him I can answer to Bird just fine.  \r\nWe settled on that. He called our new companion pretty and then approved of it like a magistrate with a wax seal.  \r\nThe moment had more warmth than the fire deserved.  \r\nHer name is [[willa-mae]].\r\n\r\nWe picked up another name in the column — [[chant]].  \r\nHe came by way of a church where the nickname stuck.  \r\nHe talks easily and listens better.  \r\nA borrowed horse under him, more endurance than pride in the saddle.  \r\nHe chats with the men at the edges and they like him for it.  \r\nIt is a simple talent. It is also rare.\r\n\r\nThere is [[little-odd-aspenleaf]].  \r\nThe name sits in the ledger like a bright pin.  \r\nTall for her name, quick in her steps, and quicker in her encouragements.  \r\nI watched her bounce from person to person, drumming up spirits and wagers both.  \r\nShe put a shine on Willa with a whispered word and a performer’s timing.  \r\nThe master watched, and sometimes he bet.  \r\nThat is what men in charge do when they want to look like part of the crowd.\r\n\r\nNot all work is on the ledger.  \r\nSome work is the circle a caravan makes when fear closes its hand.  \r\nWe drew the wagons tight, a small fortress of wood and will.  \r\nAn outrider came in with an arrow in his arm and a story in his mouth.  \r\nHe said he did not know where they came from.  \r\nHe said they took a man named Dash in one stroke.  \r\nHe did not know if Dash would stand again.  \r\nThe master told him he had done the right thing and sent him to the surgeon.  \r\nThen the master asked for volunteers.  \r\nHe called it *hazard duty* and priced it at ten gold.  \r\nMost guards found a reason to look at their boots.  \r\nA few of us did not.\r\n\r\nWilla disappeared for a short time and returned without excuse.  \r\nThat is a skill in its own right.  \r\nWords were traded with the master — the kind that open doors.  \r\nI wrote the number *twenty-five* next to them, because persuasion has a weight.  \r\nThe master told us anything we wanted to hear.  \r\nI believed only the parts the road had already taught me.\r\n\r\nChant spurred ahead.  \r\nMy mount objected. It was not a pony; it was an ill-tempered miniature horse with a sense of humor and a mean streak.  \r\nIt bucked in a polite way that still tried to throw me.  \r\nThe others’ horses balked at the hill as well.  \r\nI tried to move the beast with hard words and a harder stare.  \r\nThe hill accepted us one at a time and not on our own terms.\r\n\r\nThe fight began where the ground rose and the air thinned.  \r\nThere were hobgoblins.  \r\nOne of them broke his run long enough to haul a javelin from his quiver and put it into Brand.  \r\nThe throw was good. Brand stayed up. He kept charging.  \r\nThe next breath belonged to him.\r\n\r\nBrand reached the line and drove his antlers into the first of them.  \r\nThe hit landed. The foe staggered.  \r\nBrand followed with another strike at the cliff’s edge.  \r\nI noted the numbers because numbers keep men honest — eight on the first.  \r\nEnough to change a mind, not enough to end it.\r\n\r\nI wrote while I moved. There was no time for polish.  \r\nChant was out in front where a cheerful man becomes a banner.  \r\nLittle Odd had already made herself useful by turning nerves into action before the first blade cleared a sheath.  \r\nWilla kept her own counsel, in and out of sight when the conversation needed a fresh edge.  \r\nBrand stood where men could see him and did what a wall does.\r\n\r\nThe caravan is still moving as I finish this.  \r\nThe book says what happened.  \r\nIt says the road north from Cymbri is not safe, even with the Order nearby and the master counting coin.  \r\nIt says a man will offer hazard pay when he thinks the hazard belongs to someone else.  \r\nIt says we have work left to do because the hobgoblins did not break us.  \r\nThey only started the counting.\r\n\r\nIf I live to make a second entry, I will write more.\r\n\r\n*— [[corven-profile]], called Bird by those who refuse to try*  \r\n\r\n*(See also: [[mojon-mining-consortium]], [[sib-orveck]], [[the-mask]])*\r\n"
