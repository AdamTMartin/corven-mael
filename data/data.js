Corven was the only conscripted specialist—bound by contract, not loyalty—sent west of Rathu to a collapsed Kithalist chamber near Westcliff. The others were Mojon officers, including [[sib-orveck]], there to measure how much power still clung to the ruin. In truth, they meant to offer him as a living seal, a sacrifice to keep the chamber quiet.\n\nWhen the doors opened, the chamber did not roar—it *sang.* A sound too vast for words, older than wind or tide, struck through stone and blood alike. The Mojon guards fell first, their voices stolen mid-breath. Corven felt the contract burn out of his chest like paper in a furnace, and in its place came a chord only he could still hear—the deep undercurrent beneath all living things.\n\nThe blast tore the ruin apart. When the dust cleared, Corven was still standing, feathers scorched, eyes reflecting the rhythm of something ancient. He understood the tongue of Giants that day—not learned, but remembered. The music in the stone had spoken, and something in him had answered.\n\nHe walked away from Westcliff without looking back. The Mojon had tried to end him; the world had repurposed him. Now the melody guides his steps, a harmony he can’t name yet, but must follow. That was where Corven Mael ceased to be property—and **Echo** began.\""

By the time the Cataclysm struck, the family had divided operations between Cymbri and Khüchtei Kar, with the eastern branch holding the reins of power. The Cataclysm sundered the family, leaving the branch in the Bastion to forge a path of their own choosing, led by Jethro, youngest son of the patriarch. He took their diminished resources and focused on doing what they do best: running caravans. Within a century, the Tull’s had become prominent leaders among the Wagoneers, dominating the trade routes flowing out of Cymbri.\r\n\r\nIn the centuries since, the Tull’s have become a fixture on the roads of the Shield Lands. Jethro’s passing placed his eldest son, Jebrin, onto the Guild Council, while his second son, Jovah, took on the task of day to day operations. Jovah is a gruff but even tempered soul, and he has upheld the family reputation for reliability and honesty even as the Guild has come into conflict with many of the powers of the Bastion. Jovah prefers to be in the field, using his fortune to keep the comforts of town on hand no matter how far he is from the restaurants of Cymbri. \r\n\r\nThe Tull’s hold special contracts with the Watchful Orders and the Garit family, which makes them mainstays in the borderland region of the Shield Lands. Jovah himself leads the northern caravan to Garit’s Outpost and the newly built keep established by the Orders, though each year he swears it will be his last. \r\n\r\nRumors have been swirling since late 505 s.d. that the Tulls are considering launching an new caravan route - across the Waste, with the intent of creating a reliable route between the Bastion and the remnants of the Golden Empire of the east. Whether there is any truth to it or not, there are many who are watching closely."
