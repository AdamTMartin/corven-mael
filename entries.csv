""The night smelled of rust and stormwater. The Mojon convoy had come in under false lights—three skiffs carrying ledgers, blood vials, and prisoners still bound in work irons. Corven had been one of them until a week before, “released” to hunt down the ones who escaped with him. The Mojon liked poetic cruelty. 

He met them on the docks of Rathu’s western inlet, the tide whispering against the pylons. Their overseer, Sib Orveck, had come to collect proof of Corven’s loyalty—a head in a sack. Instead, he found a Kenku crouched by the waterline, repeating his own orders back to him in perfect mimicry. 

The first bolt struck before anyone realized the shadows were moving. Corven’s knife flashed once, then again, slicing through the rope that held a crate of volatile chronostone. When it shattered, time folded like wet paper—a half-second stutter where shouts became echoes and echoes became screams. Three men fell in the same heartbeat, their bodies a mirrored pattern in the rain. 

When the silence settled, the dock lanterns swayed. The name Corven Mael sank with the bodies, leaving only the sound of the sea repeating itself. By dawn, rumor said a voice that wasn’t a voice stalked Mojon patrols along the wharf, speaking their own words back to them just before they vanished. That was the birth of Echo.""
